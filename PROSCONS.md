# Pros

```sh
• It is a Simpler API 
• Works well with the Composition API and Typescript which would enhance developer experience
• Every store is a module by default
• Pinia dev tools available instead of using chrome dev tools to track state change
• State management pattern to follow. This also applies to Vuex.
```

# Cons
```sh
• Time travel is not included with Vue3 dev tools
```

# What to Consider
```sh
• If the current application is in maintenance mode or features are still in developement. It is safe to use Vuex until features are done before migrating to Pinia.
• You can only get the most out of Pinia using the composition API
• ngVue does not support Pinia, we would need to be completely out of Angular.
• When we migrate to Vue3 or Vue4, Vuex will still be supported and will work with both version of Vue.
```
